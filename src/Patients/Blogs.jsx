              It is not a pleasant experience to fill out long medical forms
              while visiting a hospital also Physical records can get damaged or
              lost. It is difficult for elderly folks to carry or maintain their
              medical history. It is a hectic process for hospitals to
              physically manage and store patientâ€™s past medical history. This
              became the driving force behind the creation of 'Medico'.
